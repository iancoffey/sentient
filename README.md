# Sentient: Real-time Security Research with LLMs
Sentient is a proof-of-concept project that showcases a novel approach to leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for security research. It allows researchers to effortlessly process and analyze vast amounts of security data in real-time, without the need for complex fine-tuning.

How it works:

* Effortless data ingestion: Simply tag important security messages in Slack. Sentient automatically captures and incorporates these messages into its knowledge base.
* Real-time vector search: Leveraging OpenAI's powerful embedding and vector search capabilities, Sentient builds a dynamic knowledge base using vector stores and file resources. This eliminates the need for time-consuming fine-tuning and allows for near real-time analysis.
* Intuitive natural language querying: Ask questions about your security data using natural language. Sentient's LLM, equipped with time series data and contextualized examples, provides insightful answers and assists in your research.

Key features:

* Simple and intuitive: Designed for users of all skill levels, Sentient makes advanced LLM-powered security research accessible to everyone.
* Real-time analysis: Bypasses fine-tuning for a dynamic and responsive research experience.
* Powerful insights: Leverages the capabilities of OpenAI's LLMs to provide valuable insights from your security data.
